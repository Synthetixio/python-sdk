class Spot:
    """
    Class for interacting with Synthetix V3 spot market contracts. Provider methods for
    wrapping and unwrapping assets, approvals, atomic orders, and async orders.

    Use ``get_`` methods to fetch information about balances, allowances, and markets::

        markets_by_id, markets_by_name = snx.perps.get_markets()
        balance = snx.spot.get_balance(market_name='sUSD')
        allowance = snx.spot.get_allowance(snx.spot.market_proxy.address, market_name='sUSD')

    Other methods prepare transactions, and submit them to your RPC::

        wrap_tx_hash = snx.spot.wrap(100, market_name='sUSDC', submit=True)
        unwrap_tx_hash = snx.spot.wrap(-100, market_name='sUSDC', submit=True)
        atomic_buy_tx_hash = snx.spot.atomic_order('buy', 100, market_name='sUSDC', submit=True)

    An instance of this module is available as ``snx.spot``. If you are using a network without
    spot contracts deployed, the contracts will be unavailable and the methods will raise an error.

    The following contracts are required:

        - SpotMarketProxy
