# Synthetix Python SDK

This is a Python SDK designed to help you interact with Synthetix smart contracts and subgraphs. Visit the [documentation](https://synthetixio.github.io/python-sdk/) for more information.

## Installation

To get started, install the `synthetix` library in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install synthetix
```

## Development

If you are interested in contributing to the library's development, you can clone the repository and set up the dependencies for editable mode:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./src
```

Using this method, you'll have the package installed in an 'editable mode'. This means you can easily modify the code and test your changes without the hassle of reinstalling the package every time.
